            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I graduated with a Doctor of Engineering in Information Science from Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan in March, 2018. My research work focused on developng smartphone weight loss applications that incorporated three behaviour change strateiges - stimulus control, rewards (monetary and intrinsic rewards via game playing) and social support via group-based fitness challenges. The applications were designed through a user-centred design approach and their effectiveness evaluated in in-situ trials held over 2 ro 6 weeks for each application, in Japan and Tanzania. You can read more details under the <a href="#phdresearch">Research</a> section.
			<br><br>
			I previously did my MSc and BEng (Hons) degrees at the University of Nottingham, UK, in Advanced Computing Science and Electronic and Computer Engineering respectively. I graduated from the MSc in 2011 with distinction and from the BEng in 2010 in the first class. 
			<br><br>
			I currently work as a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.nm-aist.ac.tz">Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology</a> in Arusha, Tanzania.

                My overall research objective lies in supporting digital health and education, particulalry in lower and middle income countries.
				<br><br>
				I primarily focus on developing monitoring and persuasive applications that run on ubiquitous devices such as smartphones, wearables and Internet-of-things devices, using artificial intelligence and simulations techniques, to support formal education (blended learning) especially for secondary and tertiary education, personal learning and personal and community health and wellbeing. In blended learning, my interests are on promoting accessibility and usage of online learning resources while in personal learning, my interests are on supporting cyber-skills acquistion so users can more safely and effectively participate in digital opportunities. In health and wellbeing, I am interested in supporting knowledge maternal and child health, prevention and management of chronic, lifestyle diseases and infectious diseases.   
				<br><br>
				I apply a user-centred design approach,, which I find especially important for women, children and disabled persons, who are often not considered in design of digital tools.

					<h3>Research Collaborator on Smartphone Security Knowledge and Persuasive Interventions</h3>
					<p> The study involved assessing the martphone security knowledge and OS update compliance of randomly srveyed smartphone users in Japan and Tanzania. Preferred designs of persuasive notifications to enhance compliancewere also determined. The study was done with the Cyber-resilience laboratory at Nara Institute of Science and Technology.</p>
						
					<h3 id="phdresearch">Doctoral Researcher, Ubiquitous Computing Systems Laboratory</h3>
					<p> My PhD work focused on incorporating theory-based behaviour change interventions into smartphone applications, to assist adults in losing weight. The motivation was the rising global rates of overweight and obesity, which are directly linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes II and heart disease. In developed countries, chronic diseases now account for the majority of deaths while in lower and middle income (LMIC) countries, the growing cases of chronic illnesses threaten the countries with a double burden of disease. The World Health Organization recommends behaviour change (healthy eating and increased physical activity) for weight loss and long-term healthy weight maintenance. 
					<br><br> 
					Almost half of global adults attempted to lose weight in 2014  and a study found over 75% of smartphone owners had downloaded a health and fitness application . However, over 45%2 of weight loss application users quit these applications and their weight loss goals due to lack of desired features, perceived lack of self-control and the time-consuming and tedious nature of dietary tracking. The theory-based strategies of stimulus control, rewards and social support can address these challenges. The work done in the research focused on user-centred design (interface designs, input options, scope of functionalities to be offered) of 3 smartphone applications, one for each of the strategies. 
					<br><br> 
					For the stimulus control strategy, an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2800835.2801645">application to track causes of negative eating behaviours (cues)</a> was developed. After 7 days of dietary tracking, graphs depicting calorie intake for different cues were presented to users, along with a recommended goal to lower calorie intake for the most important cue. Users adhered to the application 3x more than a control group and achieved their calorie goals 52% of the time vs. 39% for the control group. User satisfaction with the stimulus control strategy was 65%. 
					<br><br>
					To assess the impact of rewards, a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7742088">game with cash and virtual rewards</a> was implemented. Users adopted a pet dog in the game, which they had to care for by feeding and exercising. The meals a user ate was input via camera into the game and points were awarded based on how healthy the meal was. The points earned were used to purchase meals and exercise equipment and accessories for the dog. Players could see each other’s pets and the top scorers earned cash reward. Users played the game irregularly and felt the strategy was unsuitable for consistent, long term tracking, leading to a user satisfaction score of 44%. 
					<br><br>
					Social support was provided through a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8259286/">group fitness application</a> that offered a structured eating and exercise plan to groups of less than 10 known contacts. A new challenge was posted everyday e.g. “Eat 2 meals of 600Cal or less each and do 30 minutes of strength training”. Users shared photos of their meals and work outs with their teammates and they could comment or favourite each other’s posts. They could also see how well other teams were doing (overall score based on challenges achieved). The strategy results in a 2.3x improvement in adherence to fitness goals from baseline and scored 60.8% in user satisfaction. 
					<br><br>
					The results therefore revealed that supporting users to suppress triggers of negative behaviours and providing social support are more effective than the standard self-monitoring features offered on smartphone weight loss applications. In addition to these 3 studies, this research also investigated the <a href="Towards proactive food diaries: a participatory design study">"ideal" designs of smartphone weight loss applications</a> based on a focus group and survey study.

			<h3>Teaching Statement</h3>
         </div>
		 
         <div class="nine columns main-col">

            <p>My teaching experience comprises of 2 years as a lecturer (2018 to present) at <a href="https://www.nm-aist.ac.tz">the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST)</a> in Arusha, Tanzania, 8 months as a teaching assistant under the ubiquitous computing systems laboratory at Nara Institute of Science and Technology (Japan) (2016 - 2017) and 15 months as an assistant lecturer at the NM-AIST (2012-2013). I also volunteered for a year (2008-2009) as a trainer for student union and student society leaders under the Training Team at the University of Nottingham, UK. <br> <br>
				   
				   At the NM-AIST, I have taught an MSc course on Introduction to Java Programming and a PhD course on ICTs for development (PhD) as a lecturer. I have also participated in developing the curricula for courses on machine learning and data analytics (both MSc and PhD level). I previously assisted in teaching algorithm design, human-computer interactions and multimedia, which included components on web programming, and cyber ethics as an assistant lecturer. At NAIST, I delivered 3 seminars on the application of machine learning for mental health support and health behaviour change support and supported students with English proofreading.  <br> <br>
				   
				   The teaching style that has worked best for my students and I is a scenario-based approach. I begin a new topic by presenting a scenario, for instance, the challenge of manually solving a series of equations for a given model, followed by a description of how the topic in discussion e.g. built-in classes in Java, can be applied to solve or improve the scenario. In the lecture, we cycle through snippets of theory followed by live demonstrations for programming-related classes or reading through reports and publications of the impact of the technique otherwise. I adopt a conversational tone and ask questions on how the class would solve a particular problem or the class’ opinion on a particular solution, in order to improve engagement. Working in a research-based university, and being a believer of the necessity of building research skills across all students in general, I frequently include conversations on research topics related to the course content towards the end of lectures and answer any questions on research methodology. <br><br>
				   
				   Summative assessments are most important to me as they are a means of reinforcing knowledge introduced in class and gaining feedback on problematic areas to review in upcoming lectures. I provide assignments at the end of main topics, which tend to involve individual reading of publications and case eports or in-depth details of an introduced programming concept along with a practical application of the concepts learned e.g. through writing a research concept note or software application. I also provide group and individual mini-projects followed by presentations, either mid-semester or towards the end of the semester, that tie in concepts from various topics.  This assessment approach is one that was used during my own university studies and I found both then and now, that the focus on mini-projects reinforces that the purpose of lessons is not to cram concepts and pass a test or exam, but rather to learn enough theory to know when and how to use a certain approach and to know how to use resources such as books, web tutorials and communities like StackOverflow to get help in solving more complex challenges. For formative assessments, I try to ensure a mix of questions based on Bloom’s taxonomy, with an emphasis on analysis, application or evaluation.  <br><br>
				   
				   The aspect of teaching that I find most rewarding is seeing students who are new to a field gain enough knowledge and confidence to identify research gaps and pose research questions and hypotheses. The most challenging has been finding learning materials for those with a lower command of English and books that address challenges and best practices around designing and developing ICTs for the African context. Moving forward, I hope to attend pedagogy courses centred on higher education instructors and to collaborate with other academics to provide texts that present practical examples for the African context at an accessible English level.
